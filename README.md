# Simple one-feature electron wrapper for the https://www.usememos.com/ project

I don't like the https://memos.moe/ UI and couldn't find another native MacOS app for this amazing notes project, so i've decided to build up my own

This is simple Electron wrapper just to detach web-UI from browser and dock it into app folder
Nothing more, nothing less
